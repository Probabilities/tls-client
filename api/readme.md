This utilizes his tls-client-api.

## Quick Start


- Use the provided `tls-client-api-windows.exe` or download the your required binary from [here](https://github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client-api/releases)
- Open the `config.dist.yml` file and edit the details if you want to. In this file you can change the port of which the api will run on and also change the auth keys to keep your api safe.
- Run your `tls-client-api-windows.exe` and see `example.js` to see an example of how you can interact with your tls api.
